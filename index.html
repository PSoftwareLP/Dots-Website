    <h2>The defenders are awesome</h2>
    <p>Dots ist das beste Spiel der Welt! Jeder der etwas anderes behauptet hat wirklich gar keine Ahnung. </p>

    <h2>The Sanctuary</h2>

<p>At the heart of the Sanctuary lies the Spirit Stone—a fading, ancient source of magic.
Once the world’s guardian, now barely alive, it grants you one final gift:</p>

<h2>The power of infinite growth.</h2>

<p>But darkness draws near.
If the enemy breaches the Town Hall and corrupts the Core, all is lost—not just the Sanctuary, but the realm itself.</p>

<p>The Core resists the only way it knows:
By absorbing the souls of fallen enemies.</p>

<p>Every 5 waves, it amasses enough energy to open a portal to one of four mystical islands, each harboring a dormant shrine with game-changing power.</p>

<p>Champions who enter the portal must:</p>
    
<ul>
  <li>Journey to the island</li>
  <li>Battle through resurrected enemies</li>
  <li>Cleanse the shrine</li>
  <li>Claim powerful blessings for the run ahead</li>
</ul>
    
<p>But with defenders gone, the Sanctuary stands exposed.
Who dares to embark on the side quest—and who remains to protect the Core?</p>

<p>What Makes Defenders of the Sanctuary Special</p>
<h3>🔄 Endless Growth, Every Run</h3>

<p>Survive wave after wave and grow stronger with randomized upgrades, loot, and permanent soul progression.</p>
<h3>⚔️ Customize Your Champion</h3>

<p>Craft your playstyle from the ground up—choose stats, forge gear, and build unique class combinations every run.</p>
<h3>🧠 Meaningful Choices, Every Step</h3>

<p>Play it safe and earn more rewards on easier runs—or climb to harder tiers for glory, challenge, and bragging rights. Every decision has weight.</p>
<h3>🏰 Defend the Spirit Stone</h3>

<p>This is your heart, your base, your lifeline. If it falls, your run ends—and your champion is lost forever.</p>
Character Development: Power Is Earned, Not Given

<p>Your champion is more than a class—it’s a canvas for growth.</p>

<p>Your hero grows through eight core attributes—from Vitality and Recovery to Willpower, Wisdom, and Luck. But the soul of your playstyle lives in the trio of Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence, each tied to a unique category of weapons.</p>

<p>Crush enemies with raw might? Choose Strength-based weapons and become an unbreakable frontline juggernaut.
Strike fast and vanish? Lean into Dexterity and weave through battle with ruthless precision.
Prefer to wield arcane devastation? Intelligence fuels elemental and magical weapons that erupt with power.</p>

<p>Every piece of gear enhances your vision—whether you're stacking defenses to anchor your team, or gambling everything on high-risk, high-reward damage spikes.</p>

<p>Stats shape your path. Gear refines your edge. Builds are born through bold decisions.</p>

<p>No fixed classes. No predefined roles. Just endless combinations—and the freedom to reinvent yourself with every run.</p>

<p>Let’s be honest — nothing feels better than seeing that rare drop hit the ground.</p>

<p>And trust us — our inner lootgoblin is dancing in circles of pure joy just thinking about it.</p>

<p>Loot in Defenders of the Sanctuary isn’t just decoration — it’s your lifeline. Every item can make the difference between barely surviving or absolutely destroying the next wave.</p>
Stats That Scale With Quality

<p>The higher the quality of your item, the better the stat bonuses it gives — it’s that simple.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Higher armor</li>
    <li>Better damage rolls</li>
    <li>Stronger effects</li>
    <li>Potential extra properties</li>
    </ul>
